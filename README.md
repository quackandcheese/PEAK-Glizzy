# Glizzy

The first item mod to hit PEAK. Adds a glizzy (hotdog) item with jiggle physics, inspired by the Glizzy item in [LethalThings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalThings/v/0.7.0/) by [Evaisa](https://github.com/EvaisaDev).

FYI, this mod will quickly become outdated, but I will try to update it as the tools progress.

## How to find?

You have two options to finding the glizzy.

Option 1:
- Find naturally during a run.
- The glizzy has the same spawn chances as Airline Food (legendary)

Option 2:
- Use a tool like [Console Unlocker](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Spoopylocal/Console_Unlocker/) and access the dev console by pressing F1
- Type 'Item.Add com.github.quackandcheese.Glizzy:Glizzy' and press enter to spawn it in.
